# 👩‍💻 Discord Compiler

A Discord bot which can compile code, display the output of the compiler, and run the program. This bot is great for prototyping ideas, or testing concepts on-the-fly with very little effort. It supports almost every programing language you could name (rust, c++, c, java, python, & more!).

## 👩‍🏫 Usage

For more information on how to use this bot refer to our [Wiki](https://github.com/Blindspot22/compiler-bot/wiki/1.Getting-Started)

## 🔰 Hosting it yourself?

There's only two steps required to get this bot up-and-running. Our release builds only support 64-bit, if you'd like to run this on a different architecture you will have to compile the project yourself, this is also true if you wish to host this bot on MacOS.
